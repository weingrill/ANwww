								<p>Dear Reader, Dear Author,</p>
								<p>volume 342 in 2021 marks the 200<sup>th</sup> year of the foundation of
									the Astronomische Nachrichten / Astronomical Notes (AN) and the very first
									note by H.C. Schumacher in September 1821. To boldly go where no one has gone
									before, comes to my mind. Business as usual, a today’s astrophysicist could
									reply but, in any case, reason enough to celebrate. Unfortunately, we
									are in the middle on a pandemic and celebrating is also done online. We
									will feature and highlight a forthcoming article in this year’s volume
									on the history of our journal. Already in its very first volume, then not
									organized annually but by demand for 1821 to 1823, an article by
									Carl-Friedrich Gauss on the “Application of the probability calculus to
									a problem in practical geometry” was introduced and found respectful
									reception in the community. So, stay tuned for some historical articles in AN in
									2021.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p>The <a href="https://www.aip.de">Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP)</a> continues to host
									the editorial office in close collaboration with <a href="https://www.wiley-vch.de/en/">Wiley-VCH GmbH</a>.
									Last year’s volume of AN featured over 90 peer-reviewed research
									articles with a total of more than 1000 pages. It again covered a large
									variety of topics from instrumentation projects and observing campaigns
									to theoretical studies and numerical simulations. AN’s most recent
									ISI-Journal Impact Factor is 1.06.</p>
								<p>The Covid pandemic in 2020 forced many if not all meeting organizers
									to cancel their events, and thus also their proceedings. Consequently,
									only two special issues were edited in 2020, and similar will be the
									case in 2021. One workshop was “<a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/1866505/AbstractBook.pdf">Astrophysics of Hot Plasma in Extended X-ray Sources</a>”
									organized by the XMM-Newton Science Operations Center which appeared in issue 2
									in volume 341. Another one was our own in-house <a href="https://thinkshop.aip.de/16/cms/">16<sup>th</sup> Potsdam Thinkshop</a> on “The
									rotation periods of cool stars: Measurements, uses, connections and prospects”
									which took place already in September 2019. It appeared as issue 5 in volume 341
									and covered seven review articles.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<p>Finally, AN entered the article open access era as it benefits from a
									number of agreements Wiley has in place with institutions and funders
									to help authors publish open access and ensure compliance with open
									access policies. Authors from an institution affiliated with an open access
									deal may publish primary research and review articles open access at
									no charge to the author. Current open access deals exist with
									institutions from Austria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Sweden,
									The Netherlands, and UK. The effect of these open access initiatives
									becomes evident in an increased number of open access articles
									in AN as well as increased usage numbers. However, as
									a consequence of increasing open access content, our series of free
									editor’s choice articles will not be continued. A so-called hybrid
									journal, AN remains a subscription-based journal. Except for open
									access articles, no page charges are being levied.</p>
								<p>
								Sincerely yours,<br/>
								<i>Klaus G. Strassmeier</i>, Editor-in-Chief<br/>
								January 2021 </p>
